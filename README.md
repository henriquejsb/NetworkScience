# NetworkScience
A set of projects I developed for a Network Science course during my Master’s. Includes different network generators (Barabási-Albert, Erdős–Rényi), some studies on motif analysis, community discovery and PageRank, diffusion and cascading behavior, and a small analysis on a chess network as a final project.
